# Dwarf's "Sundown Boulevard" Frontend Test

This is German Cordero's approach to the interview test provided by Dwarf.

## Regarding the task

With the extra hours that Oliver gave me I was able to finish all the logic of the project. You can browse all the pages and these meet all the features that are requested in the spec file.

However, some things are still missing like styles to implement to empties content/flow boxes. Also I need to work on the page responsivness and unit test for every component. Finally the last thing missing is to add a time selector (16:00 to 23:00) in the `order page`.

## Instructions

There is no need to configure anything. Just clone this repository to your desktop and run `npm install` then wait until the installation is ready and finally run `npm start`.

## Third-Party Libraries

The following are the Third-Party libraries that I used in this project:

- [x] Axios.
- [x] Redux, Redux Thunk, React Redux, Redux devtools.
- [x] React Router.
- [x] React Slick (Slider).
- [x] Material UI.
- [x] Styled Components.
- [x] React-modern-calendar-datepicker.
- [x] Date fns.
- [x] Nanoid.
- [x] React Helmet.

## What I would have implemented with more time?

- A way to remove selected drinks if user wants to.
- A responsive Navbar.
- A better styling to the slider.
- A nice design and content to the empties content/flow boxes.
- Add React helmet to pages.
- Testing components.
