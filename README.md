# Dwarf's "Sundown Boulevard" Frontend Test

This is German Cordero's approach to the interview test provided by Dwarf.

## Regarding the task

Unfortunately I couldn't finish the project in two days because of its length and because I had another 2 tests and interviews that I was also working on. I'm very sorry because it's a nice project and I could only do 3 of the 5 pages that appear in the spec.

## Instructions

There is no need to configure anything. Just clone this repository to your desktop and run `npm install` then wait until the installation is ready and finally run `npm start`.

## Third-Party Libraries

The following are the Third-Party libraries that I used in this project:

- [x] Axios.
- [x] Redux, Redux Thunk, React Redux, Redux devtools.
- [x] React Router.
- [x] React Slick (Slider).
- [x] Material UI.
- [x] Styled Components.
- [x] React Helmet.

## What I would have implemented with more time?

- A way to remove selected drinks if user wants to.
- Start working on the `Order` and `Receipt` pages.
- Add a `DRINKS_STORE_RESET` to reset LocalStorage data when user is done with the order.
- Work on the `find order` logic.
- A responsive Navbar.
- A better styling to the slider.
- A nice design and content to the empties content/flow boxes.
- Add React helmet to pages.
- Testing components.
